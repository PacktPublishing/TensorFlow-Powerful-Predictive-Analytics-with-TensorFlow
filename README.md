**Predict valuable insights of your data with TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
* Learn TensorFlow features in a real-life problem, followed by detailed TensorFlow installation and configuration
* Explore computation graphs, data, and programming models also get an insight into an example of implementing linear regression 
  model for predictive analytics
* Solve the Titanic survival problem using logistic regression, random forests, and SVMs for predictive analytics
* Dig deeper into predictive analytics and find out how to take advantage of it to cluster records belonging to the certain group   
  or class for a dataset of unsupervised observations
* Learn several examples of how to apply reinforcement learning algorithms for developing predictive models on real-life datasets

This book covers the following exciting features:
Predictive analytics discovers hidden patterns from structured and unstructured data for automated decision making in business intelligence. Predictive decisions are becoming a huge trend worldwide, catering to wide industry sectors by predicting which decisions are more likely to give maximum results. TensorFlow, Googleâ€™s brainchild, is immensely popular and extensively used for predictive analysis.
