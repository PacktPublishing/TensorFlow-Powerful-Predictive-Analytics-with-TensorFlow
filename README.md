**Predict valuable insights of your data with TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
* Learn TensorFlow features in a real-life problem, followed by detailed TensorFlow installation and configuration
* Explore computation graphs, data, and programming models also get an insight into an example of implementing linear regression 
  model for predictive analytics
* Solve the Titanic survival problem using logistic regression, random forests, and SVMs for predictive analytics
* Dig deeper into predictive analytics and find out how to take advantage of it to cluster records belonging to the certain group   
  or class for a dataset of unsupervised observations
* Learn several examples of how to apply reinforcement learning algorithms for developing predictive models on real-life datasets

This book covers the following exciting features:
Predictive analytics discovers hidden patterns from structured and unstructured data for automated decision making in business intelligence. Predictive decisions are becoming a huge trend worldwide, catering to wide industry sectors by predicting which decisions are more likely to give maximum results. TensorFlow, Google’s brainchild, is immensely popular and extensively used for predictive analysis.
